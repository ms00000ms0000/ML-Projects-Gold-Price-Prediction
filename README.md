# ML-Projects-Gold-Price-Prediction
This **Machine Learning project** focuses on **Gold Price Prediction** using the **Random Forest Regressor** model. The input features include **SPX, GLD, USO, SLV, and EUR/USD**, which represent key financial indicators influencing gold prices. A **correlation heatmap** was constructed to visualize relationships among variables, and the **distribution of GLD prices** was analyzed to understand data patterns. The model achieved an exceptional **RÂ² score of 0.98**, demonstrating high predictive accuracy. This project showcases the use of **ensemble learning techniques** in **financial market forecasting**, providing valuable insights into commodity price trends for better investment decisions.
